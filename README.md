# Introduction

C# binding for [portaudio][portaudio] supporting Linux, macOS, and Windows.

The binding code is from copied from [PortAudioSharp][PortAudioSharp].

Different from [PortAudioSharp][PortAudioSharp], this project packages pre-compiled
[portaudio][portaudio] into the `nuget` package, which simplifies user's life.

It's worth mentioning again that the binding code is copied from
directly from [PortAudioSharp][PortAudioSharp].
